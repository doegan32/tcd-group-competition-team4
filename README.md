# tcd-group-competition-team4
## Team4's entry for TCD CS7CS4 machine learning group competition 2019/20 
## Competition Goal: predict the income.

To run the code in the jupyter-notebook the following libraries are required:
<ul><li> numpy </li><li>pandas</li><li>sklearn (scikit-learn)</li><li>lightgbm</li></ul>

<br>The following .csv files must be saved in the same folder as the jupyter-notebook:
<ul>
<li>"tcd-ml-1920-group-income-train.csv"</li>
<li>"tcd-ml-1920-group-income-test.csv"</li></ul>

<br>The model is trained on the data from "tcd-ml-1920-group-income-train.csv". The goal of the competition was to predict the income for each instance in "tcd-ml-1920-group-income-test.csv". Predictions are output to "predictions.csv".

"tcd-ml-1920-group-income-submission.csv" contains the predictions our team submitted for the competition.
