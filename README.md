## Team4's entry for TCD CS7CS4 machine learning group competition 2019/20 
## Competition Goal: predict the income of a person based on a number of features.

To run the code in the jupyter-notebook the following libraries are required:
<ul><li> numpy </li><li>pandas</li><li>sklearn (scikit-learn</li><li>lightgbm</li></ol>



The following .csv files must be saved in the same folder as the jupyter-notebook:

    "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction training (with labels).csv";  - training data
    "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction test (without labels).csv" - the test data

The model is trained on the data from "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction training (with labels).csv". The goal of the competition was to predict the income for each instance in "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction test (without labels).csv". Predictions are output to ‚Å®"attempt10.csv".

"tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction submission file10.csv" contains the predictions I submitted for the competition.
